to-do:
> create alternate header layout for mobile (done)
> checkbox option to stop automatically going into fullscreen
1. is it possible to load different elements alongside the fullscreen mode?
2. well, theres another way which is called "document.documentElement.fullscreenRequest()" which removes the status bar and i think is also prettier. may look onto that further later.
> ditch "game.html" completelety. and later on, "iframe.html" as well.  (done)
> add title and other info on the game description. (i actually did it, but fullscreen wont perform as intended this way.)
