to-do:
> create alternate header layout for mobile (done)
> checkbox option to stop automatically going into fullscreen
1. is it possible to load different elements alongside the fullscreen mode?
2. well, theres another way which is called "document.documentElement.fullscreenRequest()" which removes the status bar and i think is also prettier. may look onto that further later.
> ditch "game.html" completelety. and later on, "iframe.html" as well.  (done)
> add title and other info on the game description. (i actually did it, but fullscreen wont perform as intended this way.)
> automatically change language based on browser (done)
> fix padding issues (done)
> make so typing into search bar automatically takes you to project section
> hide vertical scrollbars and create my own
> find a cool, stylish background
> change search bar style to match the rest of the site
> add button to load game in pop-up
> hover effect for fullscreen button
> stop user from visiting home screen if there's no game loaded
> add fullscreen, mute and pause controls on the embed iframe
> cool key icons to help illustrate the control keys, which should be added with the .json
